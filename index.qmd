## Don't let the foundation fool you

Although it was organized by the "Linux Foundation", subject matter was
not just about Linux.

## 14+ sessions {auto-animate="true"}

### Very diverse subject matter

- Adding custom programs to the kernel with eBPF
- OSS Data Science for the Environment
- Securing Software Supply Chain
- How Open-Source projects get funded

**Goal today**: Just awareness of trends & tech we don't already discuss

## eBPF 

::: incremental
-   Means for mere mortals to safely inject programs into unpatched kernels

-   These programs are basically like event handlers: triggered when something happens on your machine

-   With some exceptions, programs can't change behavior, only react to it

-   Commonly have a kernel-space part written in C and a user-space part written in whatever

-   Possible use case: log OOMs affecting less than whole container to customers
:::

## WASM in kubernetes

::: incremental
-   A much faster to start & more lightweight way to sandbox

-   Community focus mostly on lambda-esque model, though they claim faster activations

-   Full k8s integration + developer tooling is by [Fermyon](https://fermyon.com/spin)

-   Core FOSS component is [containerd/runwasi](https://github.com/containerd/runwasi)

-   Individual WASM activations seem to bypass all of k8s control plane incl. scheduling
    - So it's a sorta-k8s integration
:::

## Supply Chain Security Things

::: incremental
-   Most activity due to the Linux Foundation spinning up The [Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org)

-   Has an adoption problem / too new still to be found on your average PyPI package

-   Promises a future where reputable dependencies include machine-readable attestations
    of their security posture and CI pipelines produce reports on how much risk your dep
    choices hypothetically add.

-   While I recognize the problem, strikes me as a bit hand-wavy due to the light coupling
    between attestations and actual security of the code.
:::

## Multi-Tenant Observability

An SRE going over what they did as a case study

::: incremental
-   Main takeaway: [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/) probably generally useful k8s resource wrangler

-   Metrics: spun separate Prometheus instances per tenant, prolly not best for us

-   Logs: Used fluentbit operator to live-patch fluentbit config as tenants appeared

-   Traces: Used discrete OpenTelementry and Jaeger instances per tenant
:::

## EROFS

Enhanced Read-Only filesystem

::: incremental
-   Mostly Alibaba Cloud currently funding / maintaining

-   Alibaba is engaged in the image pull problem and is building on EROFS to solve it
    - As is [Dragonfly Nydus](https://github.com/dragonflyoss/nydus), which isn't at Alibaba

-   EROFS "supports" 3 separate ways to perform filesystem overlays without even using overlayfs.
    - Actual tooling to build such EROFS devices / images not widely available, but some variants
      look achievable to recreate.
:::

## Do you CDEvents ðŸ‘€?

::: incremental
-   A standard + concrete bindings and SDKs to make CI & CD event based

-   Idea is that you could have different repo vendors, different CI workflow systems, and different deployment systems,
    but be able to standardize some concerns like notifications, signing, metrics, policy enforcement. 

-   Probably more applicable to larger teams / orgs that use many repo vendors, CI systems, etc. and have a centralized
    EngOps team

## Open Source Funding

A cool idea: [The FOSS Contributor Fund](https://github.com/indeedeng/foss-contributor-fund)

>   "Making it weird __not__ to fund FOSS"

::: incremental
-   Companies create a fund to support open-source projects.
    - Management determines bottom line available for all FOSS support
    - Which projects? Employees vote.
    - Funds are split evenly among selected projects.

## AllenAI's Open Language Model

::: incremental

-   An LLM being developed in the open in every respect, holding its own with
    proprietary models

-   The curious can study the stages of making these things
    - Presenter was top notch, left with a better understanding of
      the real substantive work going on in the oft-hyped AI space
    - Check the [LF YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@LinuxfoundationOrg/videos) for the keynote video

-   Related, the UAE has made $300M available to OSS AI training

## Random takeaways you only get in person...

::: incremental
-   The diversity landscape was amazing
    - But some of these kids make me feel old ðŸ˜‚

-   The Linux Foundation is freaking massive
    - Sufficient funding and employees to set policy on appropriate use of
      the branding of the sub-foundations
    - Also has a learning and certifications arm covering Linux and beyond

-   These Linux people are all on Macbooks?!? ðŸ¤”
